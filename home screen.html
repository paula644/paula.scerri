      <p>I’m Paula. I’m currently a student at MCAST, where I am studying an iGaming course.</p>
      <p>I’m in Level 4 now, and I’m really enjoying learning about subjects like digital marketing, game production, and legislation related to online gaming.</p>
      <p>I chose this career because, since I was 17, and maybe even before then, technology and games have really intrigued me. The enjoyment of playing video games, keeping up with what’s new in the industry itself, and learning more about how the iGaming industry works.</p>
      <img src="file:///C:/Users/paula/Downloads/wed/mcast.png" alt="MCAST Logo" class="image">
      <p>I'm excited to learn more, meet new people, and be ready for the future in this space. Reach out if you want to connect or have any questions.</p>
