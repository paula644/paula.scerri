        I like to do a lot of things. I love to draw because it’s something I can do all day and never get bored of. It also helps me express myself and what I’m feeling. Singing is good too, as it makes you feel better. If you’re ever in a bad mood, just sing or hum a song—you’ll be surprised at how much better you feel! I also enjoy going out with friends, getting some movies, or even going to the mall. But other than that, when there’s nothing else grabbing my attention (like homework and school-related things)... **RELAXATION IS THE KEY**.

        I'm also a really **hyperactive** person! I know how to ride a bike, swim, and run. From the age of 8 to 11, I enjoyed these activities until I injured my arm. I also used to dance, but had to stop the classes because they became too expensive.

        I studied at **San Andrea School**, and now I am studying **iGaming** at **MCAST** (Level 4). I’m learning more about the iGaming industry, and it’s exciting to see how much there is to explore and where this journey will lead me.
